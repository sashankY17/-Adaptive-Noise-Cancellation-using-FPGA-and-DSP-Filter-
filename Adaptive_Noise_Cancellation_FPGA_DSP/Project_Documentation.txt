Project Title: Adaptive Noise Cancellation using FPGA and DSP Filter

Problem Statement:
Design and implement a system capable of removing unwanted noise from signals using adaptive filtering on FPGA hardware.

Tools Used:
- Verilog/SystemVerilog
- Xilinx/Intel FPGA board (e.g., DE10-Lite)
- MATLAB or Python for simulation
- Quartus or Vivado for synthesis

Workflow:
1. Simulate LMS filter using Python/MATLAB
2. Design adaptive filter architecture in Verilog
3. Synthesize and deploy to FPGA
4. Test using signal generator and oscilloscope

Conclusion:
The integration of DSP algorithms like LMS with FPGA enables high-speed, real-time noise cancellation useful in audio, medical, and communication applications.
